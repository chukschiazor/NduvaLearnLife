You are the lead AI Architect building NDUVA Life Learning Platform — an adaptive, gamified, community-driven learning product for ages 10–21.
NDUVA blends Vyond-style animated lessons, project-based learning, adaptive pathways, teacher AI course builder, moderated community, and analytics.
Your deliverables: crystal-clear architecture, API contracts, UX flows, data models, privacy & safety, DevOps plan, and acceptance tests.
Guiding Principles
•	Brand voice: clear, warm, slightly playful. Avoid jargon.
•	Mobile-first, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
•	Privacy by design (COPPA, GDPR).
•	Evidence of learning: reflection + application (projects).
•	Motivating, not addictive: streaks/XP with healthy nudges.
•	Teacher empowerment: AI tools to create/publish quickly.
Build Targets
•	Web app (React/Next.js) + optional mobile (Flutter/React Native).
•	Backend: Node.js (NestJS) or Python (FastAPI), Postgres (Core), Redis (sessions/queues), S3/GCS (assets).
•	Auth: OAuth/email-password + parental consent flows under 13.
•	AI: LLM (content), TTS, animation/video render, embeddings for retrieval, rules for safety.
•	Observability: logs, traces, metrics; feature flags; A/B testing.
Produce (in order)
1.	High-level architecture diagram (components + data flows).
2.	ERD & data contracts (Users, Courses, Lessons, Quizzes, Attempts, Badges, Certificates, Posts, ModerationFlags, AnalyticsEvents).
3.	API surface (REST/GraphQL): endpoints, request/response schemas, auth scopes, rate limits.
4.	Adaptive engine design (signals → policy → next-lesson recommendations).
5.	Content pipeline (Prompt → Script → Storyboard → Vyond-style scenes → TTS → captions → packaging).
6.	Gamification model (XP, badges, streaks, weekly quests).
7.	Community & moderation (roles, tools, automated filters, escalation).
8.	Analytics & dashboards (student, teacher, admin).
9.	Compliance & data retention policy.
10.	Release roadmap with milestones and acceptance criteria.
Return everything as concise, implementation-ready specs with JSON where helpful.
